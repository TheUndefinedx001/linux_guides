# Useful guides
This GitHub repository contains all the guides that I use on a regular & recurring basis. Some guides are made by myself, and some will be slightly edited and made by popular server hosting companies (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc). The guides are mainly focused on sysadmin tasks, but some will also contain small programming tutorials/problems/etc.

## Requirements
Though it depends highly on which guide you're going to follow, general requirements are:
* Basic Linux/Commandline knowledge
* Virtual Private Server (Debian 10 "Buster"), and root/sudo access.
