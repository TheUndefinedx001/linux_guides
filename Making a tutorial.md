# Making a x001-standard tutorial

Who would have though the open-source guides and tutorials would come this far? Making everything open-source is a great idea, but we do need to watch out for lowering any standards. Have you ever followed a full guide, but ended up getting stuck because you thought you were making a mistake, but at the end, it seemed like the guide that made the mistake? TheUndefinedx001 has therefore made a "x001-standard" for making guides and tutorials. This document will explain more about it.

### Tutorial details

Each markdown file should end with the tutorial details. These details contain the basic information about whether or not this guide will result in a successful 'build' of what the reader is trying to achieve. Some guides won't need the *Tests and checks* section because it is only required when readers of the guide are given instructions with literal Linux/user/Shell commands.



**Here is a short description of what each table cell should contain:**

*Safety & Integrity*
